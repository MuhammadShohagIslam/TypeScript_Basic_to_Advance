/*
    *** What is Type ***
        => Easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has
            === For Example ===
                'green' what is this
                => It is a string
                => It's a value that has all the properties methods that we assume that a string have

    *** There are two different categories of type ***
        => Primitive Types
                --- number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null
        => Object Types
                --- function, arrays, object, class

    *** Why do we care about types ***
        =>  Types are used by the TypeScript Compiler to analyze our code for errors
        => Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing arround our codebase

    *** Where do we use types? ***
        => Everywhere beacuse it will help us to reduce error of the application
