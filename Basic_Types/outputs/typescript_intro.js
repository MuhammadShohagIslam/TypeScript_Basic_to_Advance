    *** What is TypeScript ***
        => Typescript is modern programming language as well as compiler beacuse typescript is converted to become JavaScript
        => Superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft
        => Allow static strict typing
        => Extra features - interfaces, enums, tuples, generics
        => Support modern features like arrow function, let, const
        => Based on the .NET harmony specification

    *** What's wrong with JavaScript that is why coming TypeScript***
        => Not suitable for larger application
        => Lack of strong typing
        =>  Weired inheritance, unfamiller syntax
        => Only errors during runtime
        => Suffers type coercion

    *** Benefits of TypeScript ***
        => TypeScript is equal to the JavaScript
        => Compiler to JavaScript to runs everywhere even on server
        => We can work OOP
        => New features work everywhere
